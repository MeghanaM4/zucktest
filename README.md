a quiz where you can test your knowledge of dialogue from The Social Network (2010)

## Why
The social network is one of my favorite movies of all time, and when I first watched I'm pretty sure I looped the thing 17 times. I've had a lot of the dialogue memorized, especially since I have the screenplay downloaded on my phone and read it when I don't have internet on planes and car rides, but I wanted to properly test my knowledge and wrote a quick script to isolate the dialogue from the screenplay (.txt file found on [internet archive](https://archive.org/stream/thesocialnetwork_screenplay/thesocialnetwork_screenplay_djvu.txt)) and a crappy html/css website where you can play the game. This took embarrassingly long.

## Notes
The biggest time-suck was isolating all the dialogue. I needed to get all the lines after an all-caps character name (ex. MARK) and needed to stop collecting lines after there was stage direction or a CUT TO:, and man was that tough to get around. Even though this project's pretty inane, it was fun to figure out that puzzle, and it was kinda like being back in APCSA again. Shout out to Mr. Young.

## Exigence
I thought of this while sitting on the toilet.
