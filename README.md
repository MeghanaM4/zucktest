a quiz where you can test your knowledge of dialogue from The Social Network (2010)

## Why
The social network is one of my favorite movies of all time, and when I first watched I'm pretty sure I looped the thing 17 times. I've had a lot of the dialogue memorized, especially since I have the screenplay downloaded on my phone and read it when I don't have internet on planes and car rides, but I wanted to properly test my knowledge and wrote a quick script to isolate the dialogue from the screenplay (.txt file found on internet archive) and a crappy html/css website where you can play the game. This took embarrassingly long.

## Exigence
I thought of this while sitting on the toilet.
