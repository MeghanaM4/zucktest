Did you know there are more people with genius IQ's living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States?
That can't possibly be true.
It is.
What would account for that?
Well, first, an awful lot of people live in China. But here's my question: How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT's?
They don't. I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about me.
You got 1600?
Yes. I could sing in an a Capella group, but I can't sing.
Does that mean you actually got nothing wrong?
Or you can get into a final club.
Or I can get into a final club.
You know, from a woman's perspective, sometimes not singing in an a Capella group is a good thing?
This is serious.
On the other hand I do like guys who row crew.
Well I can't do that.
I was kid—
Yes, it means I got nothing wrong on the test.
Have you ever tried?
I'm trying right now.
To row crew?
To get into a final club. To row crew? No. Are you, like—whatever—delusional?
Maybe, but sometimes you say two things at once and I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to be aiming at.
But you've seen guys who row crew, right?
No.
Okay, well they're bigger than me. They're world class athletes. And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you had met one.
I guess I just meant I liked the idea of it. The way a girl likes cowboys.
Okay.
Should we get something to eat?
Would you like to talk about something else?
No, it's just since the beginning of the conversation about finals club I think I may have missed a birthday. There are really more people in China with genius IQ's than the entire population of—
The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc.
Which one?
The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best.
Which Roosevelt?
Theodore.
Is it true that they send a bus around to pick up girls who want to party with the next Fed Chairman?
You can see why it's so important to get in.
Okay, well, which is the easiest to get into?
Why would you ask me that?
I'm just asking.
None of them, that's the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won't come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn't impress anybody around here.
Must be nice. He made $300,000 in a summer?
He likes meteorology.
You said it was oil futures.
You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance.
I asked—what?
You asked me which one was the easiest to get into because you think that that's the one where I'll have the best chance.
The one that's the easiest to get into would be the one where anybody has the best chance.
You didn't ask me which one was the best one, you asked me which one was the easiest one.
I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was just asking to ask. Mark, I'm not speaking in code. Erica—
Final clubs. Not finals clubs and there's a difference between being obsessed and being motivated.
Yes there is.
Well you do—that was cryptic—so you do speak in code.
I didn't mean to be cryptic.
I'm saying I need to do something substantial in order to get the attention of the clubs.
Why?
Because they're exclusive . And fun and they lead to a better life.
Teddy Roosevelt didn't get elected president because he was a member of the Phoenix Club.
He was a member of the Porcellian and yes he did.
Well why don't you just concentrate on being the best you you can be?
Did you really just say that?
I was kidding.
Although just because something's trite it doesn't make it any less—
I want to try to be straight forward with you and tell you that I think you might want to be a little more supportive. If I get in I'll be taking you...to the events, and the gatherings... and you'll be meeting a lot of people you wouldn't normally get to meet.
You would do that for me?
We're dating.
Okay, well I want to try and be straight forward with you and let you know that we're not anymore.
What do you mean?
We're not dating anymore, I'm sorry.
Is this a joke?
No, it's not.
You're breaking up with me?
You're going to introduce me to people I wouldn't normally have the chance to meet? What the fff—What is that supposed to mean?
Wait, settle down.
What is it supposed to mean?
Erica, the reason we're able to sit here and drink right now is cause you used to sleep with the door guy.
The door guy, his name is Bobby. I did not slept with the door guy, the door guy is a friend of mine. He's a perfectly good class of people and what part of Long Island are you from—Wimbledon?
Wait—
I'm going back to my dorm.
Wait, wait, is this real?
Yes.
Okay, then wait. I apologize, okay?
I have to go study.
Erica—
Yeah.
I'm sorry, I mean it.
I appreciate that but—
Come on.
—I have to study.
You don't have to study. You don't have to study. Let's just talk.
I can't.
Why?
Because it's exhausting. Dating you is like dating a stairmaster.
All I meant is that you're not likely to— currently—I wasn't making a comment on your parents —I was just saying you go to B.U., I was stating a fact, that's all, and if it seemed rude then of course I apologize.
I have to go study.
You don't have to study.
Why do you keep saying I don't have to study?I
Because you go to B.U.!
Do you want to get some food?
I'm sorry you're not sufficiently impressed with my education.
And I'm sorry I don't have a rowboat so we're even.
I think we should just be friends.
I don't want friends.
I was being polite, I have no intention of being friends with you.
I'm under some pressure right now with my OS class and if we could just order food I think we should—
You are probably going to be a very successful computer person.
But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a nerd. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole.
Erica Albright's a bitch. Do you think that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht or do you think it's because all B.U. girls are bitches? He takes a good gulp of his drink. We see the words we're hearing filling up his computer screen—
The truth is she has a nice face. I need to do something to help me take my mind off her. Easy enough, except I need an idea.
I think he's on to something.
Yea, it's on. I'm not gonna do the farm animals but I like the idea of comparing two people together. It gives the whole thing a very "Turing" feel since people's ratings of the pictures— A bouncer—a townie in a tuxedo and a headset—is manning the velvet rope that guards the thick, wooden, red double-doors that lead to, believe it or not, one of the most exclusive clubs in the world. Four college girls are already waiting in line but that number's about to grow as the bus pulls up and opens its doors.
First up is Kirkland. They keep everything open and allow indexes in their Apache configuration, so a little WGET magic is all that's necessary to download the entire Kirkland facebook. Kids' stuff. On the computer screen, we've been seeing him download picture after picture of Harvard girls.
Next is Elliot. They're also open but with no indexes on Apache. I can run an empty search and it returns all of the images in the database in a single page. Then I can save the page and Mozilla will save all the images for me. Excellent. Moving right along.
Dunster is intense. Not only is there no public directory but there's no—
Done.
What's going on?
Perfect timing. Eduardo's here and he's going to have the key ingredient.
Mark.
Wardo.
You and Erica split up?
How did you know that?
It's on your blog.
Yeah.
Are you alright?
I need you.
I'm here for you.
No, I need the algorithm you use to rank chess players.
Are you okay?
We're ranking girls.
You mean other students?
Yeah.
You think this is such a good idea?
I need the algorithm.
Mark—
I need the algorithm.
Give each girl a base rating of 1400. At any given time "Girl A" has a rating R-a and "Girl B" has a rating R-b.
When any two girls are matched up there's an expectation of which will win based on their current rating, right?
Yes. And those expectations are expressed this way.
Let's write it. The two girls who we just saw get let in are now dancing on a table in their underwear.
It works.
Who should we send it to first?
Dwyer.
Neal.
Who are you gonna send it to?
Just a couple of people. The question is, who are they gonna send it to? We move to a room where there's a co-ed poker game underway with the girls smoking cigars. A bra and a couple of pairs of stockings are out on the table. As we move through the poker room, we see a computer behind one of the players. The computer is indicating that there's e-mail.
This is an awful lot of traffic. Think maybe we should shut it down before we get into trouble.
You don't think—
I do.
Go see if it's everybody.
Can't connect.
The network's down.
Unless it's a coincidence I think this is us.
It's not a coincidence.
Holy shit.
So you were called in front of the Ad Board.
That's not what happened.
You weren't called in front of the Administrative Board?
No, back, I mean—That's—back at the bar with Erica Albright. She said all that?
Mark, I wouldn't—
That I said that stuff to her?
I was reading from the transcript of her deposition so—
Why would you even need to depose her?
That's really for us to—
You think if I know she can make me look like a jerk I'll be more likely—
Mark—
—to settle?
Why don't we stretch our legs for a minute, can we do that? It's been almost three hours and frankly you did spend an awful lot of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg with the girl's testimony from the bar.
I'm not embarrassed, she just made a lot of that up.
She was under oath.
Then I guess that would be the first time somebody's lied under oath. People are stretching and getting coffee and talking quietly.
The site got twenty-two hundred hits within two hours?
Thousand.
What?
Twenty-two thousand.
Wow. The Harvard Crew is practicing on two-man sculls. There are three boats that are running roughly even with each other and the two-man crews are rowing with all they've got. We're gliding along with them in the water—
Is there anyway to make this a fair fight?
We could jump out and swim.
I think we'd have to jump out and drown.
Or you could row forward and I could row backward.
We're genetically identical, science says we'd stay in one place.
Row the damn boat.
What's up?
You guys hear about this?
What?
Two nights ago a sophomore choked the network from a laptop at Kirkland.
Really?
At 4AM.
How?
He set up a website where you vote on the hotness of female undergrads. What were we doing that none of us heard about this?
I don't know, a three hour low-rate technical row before breakfast, a full course load, studying, another three hours in the tank and then studying. I don't know how we missed it. How much activity was there on this thing that he—
22,000 page requests.
22 , 000 ?!
Cam, this guy hacked the into facebooks of seven houses. He set up the whole website in one night and he did it while he was drunk.
22 , 000 .
Yeah.
How do you know he was drunk?
He was blogging simultaneously. You know what I think?
I'm way ahead of you.
This is our guy.
Tyler Winklevoss. Tyler's spelled the usual way and my last name is the same as my brother 1 s.
Uh...I've, you know—
I've already apologized in the Crimson to the ABHW, to Fuerza Latina and to any women at Harvard who might have been insulted as I take it that they were. As for any charges stemming from the breach of security, I believe I deserve some recognition from this Board.
Yes.
Which part?
I believe I pointed out some pretty gaping holes in your system. COX Excuse me, may I?
Four hours? COX Yes sir.
That would be impressive except if you'd known what you were looking for you would have seen it written on my dorm room window. As the heavy wooden door from the hearing slams shut behind
So?
Six months academic probation. They walk out onto—
Wow, they had to make an example out of you.
They had my blog. I shouldn't have written the thing about the farm animals. That was stupid. I was kidding for God's sake, doesn't anybody have a sense of—
I tried to stop you. I know.
I know.
You can't do that.
Wardo. I said I know.
1 valid bit, 1 modify bit, 1 reference bit and 5 permission bits.
Are you Mark Zuckerberg?
Yeah.
Cameron Winklevoss.
Hi.
Tyler Winklevoss.
You guys related?
That's good.
That's funny.
We've never heard that before.
What can I do for you? Did I insult your girlfriends?
No, you didn't insult our girl— Actually, I don't know.
We never asked.
We should do that. No, we have an idea we want to talk to you about. Do you have a minute?
You guys look like you spend some time at the gym.
We have to.
Why?
We row crew.
Yeah, I've got a minute. Great.
You ever been inside the Porcellian?
No.
You understand we can't take you past the bike room 'cause you're not a member.
I've heard.
Would you like a sandwich or something?
Okay.
Mark, right?
Yeah.
This is Divya Narendra, our partner.
Hi.
We were really impressed with Facemash and then we checked you out and you also built CourseMatch.
I don't know CourseMatch.
You go online and see what courses your friends are taking. Really smart, man.
Mark?
Yeah.
We were talking about CourseMatch.
It was kind of a no-brainer.
And you invented something in high school, right?
An app for an MP3 player that recognizes your taste in music.
Anybody try to buy it?
Microsoft.
How much?
I didn't sell it. I uploaded it for free.
For free?
Yeah.
Why?
Okay, well. We have something that we've been working on for a while, we think it's great. It's called the HarvardConnection. You create your own page. Interests, bio, friends, pics.
And then people can go online, see your bio and request to be your—
Yeah. How's it different from MySpace or Friendster?
Harvard.edu. The most prestigious e-mail address in the country.
And the whole site's kinda based on the idea that girls—well...
Not to put anything indelicately.
Girls wanna get with guys who go to Harvard.
Divya and my brother don't have trouble putting things indelicately.
The difference between what we're talking about and MySpace or Friendster or any of those other social networking site—
—is exclusivity. Right?
Right.
Yes.
We'd love for you to work with us, Mark. I mean, we need a gifted programmer who's creative.
And we know you've taking it in the shins.
The women's groups are ready to declare a Fatwa and this could help rehabilitate your image.
Wow. You'd do that for me?
We'd like to work with you.
Our first programmer graduated and went to work at Google. Our second programmer just got overwhelmed with school work.
We would need you to build the site and write the code and we'll provide—
I'm in.
—the money. What?
I'm in.
Awesome.
That's what you said?
It was three or four years ago, I don't know what I said.
When did you come to Eduardo?
I don't understand that question.
Do you remember answering in the affirmative?
The affirmative?
When did you come to Eduardo with the idea for Facebook.
It was called TheFacebook then.
This doesn't need to be that difficult.
I'm currently in the middle of two different lawsuits.
Did you answer affirmatively? When Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Narendra asked you to build HarvardConnection, did you say yes?
I said I'd help.
When did you approach Mr. Saverin with the idea for TheFacebook?
I wouldn't say I approached him.
Sy?
You can answer the question.
At a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.
What's that?
The Jewish fraternity. It was Caribbean Night. The hall has been converted into "Alpha Epsilon Pi Caribbean Night, 2003" and the party is about as lame as it sounds. What's important is that this couldn't be less like the final club party we saw at the beginning if they were playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey. Some potted palm trees have been brought in along with a steel drum set. The man playing the steel drum set has a yarmulke bobby pinned to his thinning hair. A table with a punch bowl and assorted cookies is nearby.
It's not that guys like me are generally attracted to Asian girls. It's that Asian girls are generally attracted to guys like me.
I'm developing an algorithm to define the connection between Jewish guys and Asian girls.
I don't think it's that complicated. They're hot, they're smart, they're not Jewish and they can't dance.
Mark's here.
Mark.
I'll be right back.
I think I've come up with something.
Hang on, I've gotta tell you something you're not going to believe.
What?
I got punched by the Phoenix.
Are you kidding?
No. I mean it's just the first of the four step process but they slipped the invitation under my door tonight. I go to the first punch party tomorrow and if they like me—
You got punched by the Phoenix.
It was, you know...it was probably just a diversity thing. It was just a diversity thing. I'll just ride that horse until— what did you want to talk to me about? Mark?
Yeah.
You said you've come up with something.
Yeah. I think I've come up with something. Come outside.
It's 20 degrees outside.
I can't stare at that loop of Niagara Falls which has nothing to do with the Caribbean.
People came to Facemash in a stampede, right?
Yeah.
It wasn't because they saw pictures of hot girls. You can go anywhere on the internet and see pictures of hot girls.
Yeah.
It was because they saw pictures of girls that they knew . People want to go on the internet and check out their friends. Why not build a website that offers that? Friends, pictures, profiles, whatever you can...visit, browse around, maybe it's somebody you just met at a party. I'm not talking about a dating site. I'm talking about taking the entire social experience of college and putting it online.
I can't feel my legs.
I know, I'm totally psyched about this, too. But Wardo—
"It would be exclusive".
You'd have to know the people on the site to get past your own page. Like getting punched.
That's good, that's new.
Wardo, it's like a Final Club except we're the president.
I told him I thought it sounded great. It was a great idea. There was nothing to hack, people were going to provide their own pictures, their own information. And people had the ability to invite—or not invite—their friends to join. See, in a world where social structure was everything, that was the thing. It was a big project and he was going to have to write tens of thousands of lines of code so I wondered why he was coming to me and not his roommates. Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes they were programmers.
We're gonna need a little start-up cash to rent the servers and get it online.
That was why.
Did he offer terms?
We'll split it 70-30. 70 for me 30 for you for putting up the thousand dollars and handling for everything on the business end. You're CFO.
And you said?
I said "Let's do it".
Okay. Did he add anything else?
Yes.
It probably was a diversity thing but so what?
Why do you think he said that?
Gretchen, excuse me for interrupting but whose discovery is this?
Sy, if you'll let me continue with my line of questioning—
What are you suggesting?
They're suggesting I was jealous of Eduardo for getting punched by the Phoenix and began a plan to screw him out of a company I hadn't even invented yet. 42.
Were you?
Gretchen—
Jealous of Eduardo?
Stop typing, we're off the record.
Ma'am, I know you've done your homework and so you know that money isn't a big part of my life, but at the moment I could buy Mount Auburn Street, take the Phoenix Club and turn it into my ping pong room.
I'll let you know how the party is.
We recognize that you're a plaintiff in one suit involving Facebook and a witness in another.
Yes sir.
At any time in the weeks prior to Mark's telling you his idea, did he mention Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss, Divya Narendra or HarvardConnection? 43.
Yes. He said they'd asked him to work on their site but that he'd looked at what they had and decided it wasn't worth his time. He said even his most pathetic friends knew more about getting people interested in a website than these guys.
"These guys" meaning my clients.
Yes. He resented—Mark resented that they— your clients, thought he needed to rehabilitate his image after Facemash but Mark didn't want to rehabilitate anything. With Facemash he'd hacked into the Harvard computers, he'd thumbed his nose at the Ad Board, he'd gotten a lot of notoriety. Facemash did exactly what he wanted it to do.
Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building TheFacebook he was also communicating with the plaintiffs?
Not at the time I wasn't, but it really didn't have much to do with the Winklevoss's dating—
You weren't there!
Ty. Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg was building TheFacebook, he was leading the plaintiffs to believe he was building Harvard Connection?
You're offering a conclusion not found in evidence.
We're about to find it in evidence. 44.
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler Winklevoss. November 30, 2003. "I read over all the stuff you sent me re Harvard Connection and it seems like it shouldn't take too long to implement, so we can talk about it after I get all the basic functionality up tomorrow night." The whiteboard is filled with diagrams now—login page,
From Mark Zuckerberg to Cameron Winklevoss. December 1, 2003. "Sorry I was unreachable tonight. I just got about three of your missed calls. I was working on a problem set for my systems class."
From Mark Zuckerberg to Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. December 10, 2003. "This week has been pretty busy thus far with classes and work so I think it's probably best to postpone the meeting."
"I'm also really busy tomorrow." Anybody else feel like there's something up with this guy?
Tell him okay but we've gotta make sure that we meet up before we all go off for break.
Mark—
I need a dedicated Linux box running Apache with a mySQL backend. It's gonna cost a little more money.
How much more?
Two-hundred more.
Do we need it?
Gotta handle the traffic.
Do it.
I already did.
Hey, guess what? I made the second cut.
Good job. You should be proud of that right there, don't worry if you don't make it any further.
I'll get outa here.
From Mark Zuckerberg to Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Narendra. December 15, 2003. "I have a cs problem set that I'm just getting started with and it should be about 15 hours of coding so I'll be busy tomorrow night." 47.
"I won't really be free to meet until next Wednesday afternoon."
"...have to cancel Wednesday afternoon. I've basically been in the lab this whole time and also..."
"Won't be able to do Saturday as I have to meet up with my parents to..."
I know.
1) Harvard was founded in 1636, not 1638. 2) Harvard wasn't founded by John Harvard and 3) That's not John Harvard.
A friend of the sculptor, Daniel Chester.
39 days after Mr. Zuckerberg's initial meeting with my clients and he still hadn't completed work on HarvardConnection. But on January 11, 2004 — A website called Network Solutions is up on Mark's screen. He hits a couple of keys and waits intently. Then the computer shows him what he wanted to see—
Mr. Zuckerberg registered the domain name theFacebook via network solutions. 49.
To the best of your knowledge, had he even begun work on HarvardConnection?
Not to my knowledge, no.
What in the world is this? "Hey Cameron. I'm still a little skeptical that we have enough functionality in the site to really draw the attention and gain the critical mass necessary to get a site like this to run. We'll speak soon."
This is the first time he mentioned any problem?
Yes it was.
You'd sent 36 e-mails to Mr. Zuckerberg and received 16 return e-mails and this was the first time he indicated he was not happy.
That's correct. He had 42 days to study our system and get out ahead on—
Do you see any of your code on Facebook?
Sy, could you—
Mark—
Did I use any of your code?
You stole our whole goddam idea!
Fellas.
Match-dot-com for Harvard guys?
Can I continue with my deposition?
You know you really don't need a forensic team to get to the bottom of this. If you guys were the inventors of Facebook you'd have invented Facebook.
I can't wait to stand over your shoulder and watch you write us a check.
No shit?
Let's continue.
February 4th, 2004—
Mark? Mark.
There's a girl in your art history class. Her name is Stephanie Attis. Do you happen to know if she has a boyfriend?
Have you ever seen her with anyone? And if not, do you happen to know if she's looking to go out with anyone?
Dustin. People don't walk around with a sign on them that says—
Mark?
We were supposed to meet at 9.
Have you slept yet?
I have to add something.
What?
Shit. That looks good. That looks really good.
It's clean and simple. No Disneyland, no Live Nude Girls.
But watch.
What'd you write?
"Relationship Status", "Interested In", This is what drives life at college. Are you having sex or aren't you. It's why people take certain classes, and sit where they sit, and do what they do, and at its, urn, center, you know, that's what theFacebook is gonna be about. People are gonna log on because after all the cake and watermelon there's a chance they're actually gonna—
—get laid.
—meet a girl. Yes.
That's really good.
And that's it.
What do you mean?
It's ready.
It's ready?
Yeah.
Right now?
That was it. And here's the masthead.
You made a masthead.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You have no idea what that's going to mean to my father.
Sure I do.
When's it gonna go live?
Right now. Get your laptop out.
Why do we need my laptop?
Because you've got e-mails for everyone at the Phoenix.
I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool with them that I spam their—
This is not spam.
No, I know it's not spam—
If we send it to our friends it'll just bounce around the Dworkin.
I haven't gotten in yet.
These guys know people and I need their e- mails.
Sure.
Good.
Gimmie the mailing list.
These guys. They're literary geniuses because the world's most obvious Lewis Carroll reference—
They're not so bad.
I'm just saying.
You're right. He hits "Send".
The site's live.
You know what? Let's go get a drink and celebrate. I'm buying.
Mark?
Mark? Are you praying?
Honey, you should put the laptop away. K.C. Seven different people spammed me the same link.
K.C.— She clicks on the link—
It's fine. He starts out again, then comes back for his coat, grabs it, starts out and falls down all over again. Finally he's got it together and flies out of the pub and we
Hey! The twins are in the zone and don't pay any attention.
Hey!
Not now, we need 20 minutes.
Okay. I just wanted to let you know Zuckerberg stole our website.
Mark Zuckerberg stole our website. It's been live for more than 36 hours.
Ty, the lawyer's on the phone with Dad. I'm here with my brother, Tyler, and our business partner, Divya.
"Welcome to theFacebook. TheFacebook is an online directory that connects people through different social networks. You must have a Harvard.edu address to register."
That's right.
I called earlier. I'm looking for Mark Zuckerberg.
Yes sir, he's quoted a couple of times. I can read it to you, "'Everyone's been talking a lot about a universal facebook within Harvard', he says"—he meaning Mark—"'I think it's kind of silly that it would take the University a couple of years to get around to it. I can do a classier job than they can and I did in a week. '"
Tell him Divya Narendra called, I appreciate it.
I know, that's how he talks.
Crimson) "As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said over 650 students had registered to use theFacebook.com. He said he anticipated that 900 students would have joined the site by this morning."
Yeah, Divya was just reading that 650 students signed up for it on the first day.
If I were a drug dealer I couldn't give free drugs to 650 people in one day.
And this guy doesn't have three friends to rub together to make a fourth.
Guys, please, come on. That's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss. We'll put all this together and we'll email it to you. You won't be able to get on the website yourself. Because you don't have—a Harvard, umm— You know what, it would just be easier for us to email it to you. No, I'm sure you're right, this is a good guy—
Wow! !
—and he's very bright and I'm sure he didn't mean to...do what he did. Thank you very much, and Dad—alright love you too.
This is a good guy?
We don't know that he's not a good guy.
We know that he stole our idea. We know he lied to our faces for a month and a half while he—
He never lied to our faces .
I'm a competitive racer, Div, I don't think you need to school me on the importance of getting there first, thank you.
Alright. That was your father's lawyer?
It was his in-house counsel, he'll look at it and if he thinks it's appropriate he'll send a cease and desist letter.
What's that gonna do?
No, I wanna hire the Sopranos to beat the shit out of him with a hammer.
We don't even have to do that.
That's right.
We can do that ourselves.
Hey—
I'm six-five, 220 and there's two of me.
I'm with this guy.
And I'm saying let's calm down until we know what we're talking about.
How much more information are you waiting for? We met with Mark three times, we exchanged 52 e-mails, we can prove that he looked at the code— What is that on the bottom of the page?
It says "A Mark Zuckerberg Production".
On the home page?
On every page.
Shit, I need a second to let the classiness waft over me.
Look—
Cam. They wrote, "Zuckerberg said that he hoped the privacy options would help to restore his reputation following student outrage over Facemash.com". That's exactly what WE said to him. He's giving us the finger in the Crimson. Now while we're waiting for Dad's lawyer to look this stuff over, we can at least—
No.
—get something going in the paper so that people know—
What?
That this thing is in dispute.
We're not starting a knife fight in the Crimson and we're not suing anybody.
Why not?
I don't understand, why not?
He's gonna say it's stupid.
Me?
Say it. Why not?
Because we're gentlemen of Harvard. This is Harvard. You don't plant stories and you don't sue people.
You thought he was going to be the only one who thought that was stupid?
During the time when you say you had this idea, did you know Tyler and Cameron came from a family of means?
A family of means?
Did you know that his father was wealthy.
I'm not sure why you're asking me that.
It's not important that you be sure why I'm asking you.
It's not important to you.
Sy.
Did you know that they came from money?
I had no idea whether they came from money or not.
In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra you referenced Howard Winklevoss' consulting firm.
If you say so.
Howard Winklevoss founded a firm whose assets are in the hundreds of millions.
Mm-hm. . .
You also knew that Cameron and Tyler were members of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian.
They pointed that out.
Excuse us for inviting you in.
To the bike room.
Please. So it's safe to say you were aware that my clients had money?
Yes.
Let me tell you why I'm asking. I'm wondering why, if you needed a thousand dollars for an internet venture, you didn't ask my clients for it.
They'd demonstrated to you an interest in this kind of thing so—
I went to my friend for the money because that's who I wanted to be partners with. Eduardo was the president of the Harvard Investors Association and he was my best friend.
Your best friend is suing you for 600- million dollars.
I didn't know that, tell me more.
Eduardo, what happened after the initial launch?
I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind addressing him as Mr. Saverin?
Gretchen, they're best friends.
Not anymore.
We already went through this on the— nevermind. Mr. Saverin, what happened after the initial—
It exploded.
Everyone on campus was using it. "Facebook me" was a common expression after two weeks.
And Mark?
Mark was the biggest thing on a campus that included 19 Nobel Laureates, 15 Pulitzer Prize winners, two future Olympians and a movie star.
Who's the movie star?
Does it matter?
No. The lamps in Harvard Yard light the snow falling.
Your friend—is that Mark Zuckerberg?
Uh...yes.
He made theFacebook.
Yeah. I mean it's both of ours—but, yeah we—yes.
Cool. I'm Christy. This is Alice.
Very nice to meet you.
Facebook me when you get home. Maybe we can all go out and grab a drink later.
Certainly. Absolutely I will do that.
She said "Facebook me" and we can all go for a drink later. Which is stunningly great for two reasons. One, she said "Facebook me". Right? And the other is, you know—
They want to have drinks later.
Yes I Have you ever heard so many different good things packed into one regular-sized sentence?
Yeah.
Sure.
How you doin'. BOB You know, I could swear he was looking at you when he said the next Bill Gates could be right in this room.
I doubt it. BOB I showed up late, I don't even know who the speaker was.
It was Bill Gates. BOB Shit, that makes sense.
Alright, thanks guys.
It's time to monetize the thing.
What were their names?
Did you hear what I said?
When?
I said it's time to monetize the site.
What does that mean?
It means it's time for the website to generate revenue.
No I know what the word means. I'm asking how do you want to do it?
Advertising.
No.
We've got 4000 members.
'Cause theFacebook is cool. If we start installing pop-ups for Mountain Dew it's not gonna—
Well I wasn't thinking Mountain Dew but at some point—and I'm talking as the business end of the company—the site—
We don't even know what it is yet. We don't know what it is, we don't know what it can be, we don't know what it will be. We know that it's cool, that is a priceless asset I'm not giving it up.
When will it be finished?
It won't be finished, that's the point. The way fashion's never finished. What?
You're talking about fashion? Really? You?
I'm talking about the idea of it and I'm saying it's never finished.
Okay, but they manage to make money selling pants...
Mark, what is this?
What.
This .
It's called a cease and desist letter. What were their names?
Who?
The girls.
When did you get this?
About 10 days ago. Right after we launched the site.
Jesus Christ.
Hey, the girls. What were their names?
They're saying—the Winklevoss twins are saying you stole their idea.
I find that to be a little more than mildly annoying.
They find it to be intellectual property theft. Why—
Look—
—why didn't you show this to me?
It was addressed to me.
They're saying we stole theFacebook from Divya Narendra and the Wink—
I know what it says.
Did we?
Did we what?
Don't screw around with me now. Look at me.
The letter says we could face legal action.
No, it says I could face legal action.
It's from a lawyer, Mark. They must feel they have some grounds for—
The lawyer is their father's house counsel.
Do they have grounds?
The grounds are our thing is cool and popular and HarvardConnection is lame. Wardo, I didn't use any of their code, I promise I didn't use anything. A guy who builds a really nice chair doesn't owe money to everyone who has ever built a chair. They came to me with an idea, I had a better one.
Why didn't you show me the letter?
I didn't think it was a big deal.
If there's something wrong—if there's ever anything wrong—you can tell me. I'm the guy that wants to help. This is our thing. Is there anything you need to tell me?
No.
What are we doing about this?
What did you say?
"When we met in January, I expressed my doubts about the site—where it stood with graphics, how much programming was left that I had not anticipated—
"—the lack of hardware we had to deal with, site use, the lack of promotion that would go on to successfully launch the website—
This was the first time you raised any of those concerns, right?
I'd raised concerns before.
Gentlemen. I'm talking about at the meeting in January to which this letter is referring.
Yeah.
Let me re-phrase this. You sent my clients 16 e-mails. In the first 15, you didn't raise any concerns.
Is that a question?
In the 16th e-mail you raised concerns about the site's functionality. Were you leading them on for six weeks?
No.
Why hadn't you raised any of these concerns before?
It's raining.
I'm sorry?
It just started raining.
Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention?
No.
Do you think I deserve it?
What.
Do you think I deserve your full attention?
I had to swear an oath before we began this deposition and I don't want to perjure myself so I have a legal obligation to say no.
Okay. "No" you don't think I deserve your attention.
I think if your clients want to sit on my shoulders and call themselves tall they have a right to give it a try. But there's no requirement that I enjoy sitting here listening to people lie. You have part of my attention—you have the minimum amount. The rest of my attention is back at the offices of Facebook where my colleagues and I are doing things that no one in this room, including and especially your clients, are intellectually or creatively capable of doing. Did I adequately answer your condescending question?
I've got 12:45. Why don't we say that's lunch.
Back at 2:30? Everyone gets up and we
So, what were their names?
Their names were Christy and Alice. They want to have drinks tonight. It's a nice men's room—mahogony stalls—in a nice club in Cambridge. We HEAR the thumping of the house music coming from the club.
Shit.
I don't care.
Sorry. It'll just be a minute. Some girls are freshening up in there. CLUB GUY Sweet. The guy goes off.
We have groupies.
I'll be right back.
Mark, where you going? Mark?
Erica?
Hi.
I saw you from over there. I didn't know you came to this club a lot.
First time.
Mine too. Could I talk to you alone for a second?
I think I'm good right here.
I just—I'd love to talk to you alone. If we could just go someplace—
Right here's fine.
I don't know if you heard about this new website I launched.
No.
TheFacebook?
You called me a bitch on the internet, Mark.
That's why I wanted to talk to you. If we could just—
On the internet.
That's why I came over.
Comparing women to farm animals?
I didn't end up doing that.
It didn't stop you from writing it. As if every thought that tumbles through your head is so clever it would be a crime for it not to be shared. The internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink and you published that Erica Albright was a bitch right before you made some ignorant crack about my family's name, my bra size and then rated women based on their "hotness".
No, there's no problem. You write your snide bullshit from a dark room because that's what the angry do nowadays. I was nice to you. Don't torture me for it.
If we could just go somewhere for a minute—
No, I don't want to be rude to my friends.
Okay.
Okay. Good luck with your video game.
Hey, that was great. That was the right thing to do. You apologized, right?
We have to expand.
What?
Is he mad about something?
We're expanding to Yale and Columbia. Dustin, I want you to share the coding work with me. Chris, you're going to be in charge of publicity and outreach and you can start by getting a story in the B.U. student newspaper. The Bridge.
They hate doing stories about Harvard.
Somebody at the newspaper will be a computer science major. Tell 'em Mark Zuckerberg will do 10 hours of free programming.
Why do you want a story in the B.U. newsp—
Because I do. Here's the arrangement. Eduardo is CFO and owns 30% of the company. Dustin is Vice President and Head of Programming and his 5% of the company will come from my end. Chris is Director of Publicity and his compensation will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing. Any questions?
Who are the girls?
Christy and Alice.
Hi. Hi.
Hello.
Hi.
No. That's it. Yale and Columbia, let's go.
And Stanford.
What?
Stanford. It's time for them to see this in Palo Alto.
You don't want any lunch?
No.
You're welcome to some salad.
No thank you.
This must be hard.
Who are you?
I'm Marylin Delpy, I introduced myself—
I mean what do you do?
I'm a second year associate at the firm. My boss wanted me to sit in on the deposition phase.
What are you doing?
Checking in to see how it's going in Bosnia.
Bosnia?
They don't have roads but they have Facebook?
You must really hate the Winklevoss's.
I don't hate anybody. The Winklevi aren't suing me for intellectual property theft. They're suing me because for the first time in their lives, things didn't work out the way they were supposed to for them.
He's expanding. What?
Really.
Yeah.
So that Cease and Desist letter really scared the shit out of him, huh?
I want to hire a lawyer to file for injunctive relief and get this website taken down now'.
Look—
Every minute the site is up. Harvard Connection becomes less valuable. I want an injunction, I want damages, I want punitive relief and I want him dead.
I want those things too!
Then why aren't we doing anything about it?! Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?!
Because you're not thinking about how it'll look.
How'll it look?
Like my brother and I are in skeleton costumes chasing the Karate Kid around a high school gym.
He's violated Massachusetts state law. When he goes to Connecticut, New York and California he'll have violated federal law. And by the way, he's in violation of Harvard law.
There's no such thing as Harvard Law.
Wait. Yes there is.
Harvard Student Handbook. Every freshman is issued one of these. Somewhere in this book it says—
—you can't steal from another student. This is what we needed. We're going to Summers.
You can't get a meeting with Larry Summers.
My brother and I pay tuition at this school, we carry a 3.9 GPA at this school, we've won trophies for this school and we'll be rowing in the Olympics for this school. I want a meeting with the goddam president of this school. Why Stanford?
Why do you think?
I'm sorry, I'm late for Bio-Chem.
Okay.
You don't know my name, do you?
Is it Stanford?
I should just kick your ass. How can you go to a party, meet—
Amelia Ritter but you prefer Amy. You're from Orinda, your father's in commercial real estate and your mother's 10 years sober.
What's my major?
Trombone.
Really?
I remember something about a trombone.
Tu fais 1 1 amour a la jolie fille et la mets de cote.
French! Your major is French.
Oui. And yours?
Mine? I don't have one.
You haven't declared?
I don't go to school.
You're kidding?
No.
Where did you go to school?
William Taft Elementary for a little while.
Seriously, you're not like 15 years old or anything are you?
No. You're not like—
No. So what do you do?
I'm an entrepreneur.
You're unemployed.
I wouldn't say that.
What would you say?
That I'm an entrepreneur.
What was your latest preneur?
Well...I founded an internet company that let folks download and share music for free.
Kind of like Napster?
Exactly like Napster.
What do you mean?
I founded Napster.
Sean Parker founded Napster.
Nice to meet you.
You're Sean Parker?
Ah ha. The shoe's on the other...
Foot?
—table which has turned.
I just slept with Sean Parker?
You just slept on Sean Parker.
You're a zillionaire.
Not technically.
What are you?
Broke. There's not a lot of money in free music. Even less when you're being sued by everyone who's ever been to the Grammys.
This is blowing my mind.
I appreciate that.
I have to hop in the shower and get ready for class.
Bio-chem, even though you're a French major whose name is Amy.
You passed.
I'm a hard worker.
There's juice or anything else you can find. Help yourself.
You mind if I check my e-mail?
Go ahead.
Amy? She can't hear him in the shower.
Jesus. He gets up and goes to the bathroom door—
Amy?
Yeah!
Can you come out here?
Just a second!
There's a snake in here, Amy.
What?!
Where?!
There isn't a snake, but I need to ask you something.
Are you kidding me?! I could have been killed!
How?
By running too fast...and getting twisted in the curtain—What do you need to ask me?
I went to check my e-mail and there's a site open on your computer.
After you passed out last night I went on theFacebook for a little bit.
What's that?
TheFacebook? Stanford's had it for like two weeks now it's really awesome except it's freakishly addictive. Seriously, I'm on the thing like five times a day.
You mind if I grab a piece of paper and a pen?
Is everything okay?
Everything's great. I just need to find you, Mark Zuckerberg.
I've never been in this building before.
We're sitting in chairs.
That's just their own stupidity, I should have been there. Darkness is the absence of light and stupidity in that instance was the absence of me.
Catherine, I have students in my office now.
Students. Undergrads. I don't know, from the looks of it they want to sell me a Brooks Brothers franchise. Alright.
Good morning.
Good morning, sir. I'm Cameron Winklevoss and this is my brother, Tyler.
And you're here because...
Either one of you can answer.
I'm sorry, I thought you were reading the letter.
I've read the letter.
We came up with an idea for a website called HarvardConnection—we've since changed the name to ConnectU—and Mark Zuckerberg stole that idea and—
I understand. I'm asking what do you want me to do about it.
Well sir, in The Harvard Student Handbook , which is distributed to each freshman—under the heading "Standards of Conduct in the Harvard Community"—
—it says, "The College expects that all students will be honest and forthcoming in their dealings with members of this community. All students are required to respect public and private ownership. Instances of theft, misappropriation—
Anne? ANNE Yes sir.
Punch me in the face. Go ahead.
...or unauthorized use will result in disciplinary action. Including requirement to withdraw from the college.
And you memorized that instead of doing what?
What my brother and I came here today to ask of you, respectfully of course, is that—
bullshit) Sir, it's against University rules to steal from another student, plain and simple.
You've spoken to your House Master?
Yes sir, and the House Master made a recommendation to the Ad Board but the Ad Board won't see us.
Have you tried dealing with the other student directly?
Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't been responding to any of our e-mails or phone calls for the last two weeks. He doesn't answer when we knock on his door at Kirkland and the closest we've come to dealing with him face to face is when I saw him on the quad and chased him through Harvard Square.
You chased him?
I saw him and I know he saw me and I went after him but he disappeared.
I don't see this as a University issue.
Of course this is a University issue. There's a code of ethics and an honor code and he violated them both.
You entered into a code of ethics with the university, not with each other.
I'm sorry President Summers, what you just said makes no sense to me at all.
I'm devastated by that.
What my brother means is that if Mark Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and stole our computer that would be a university issue, right?
I really don't know, this office doesn't handle petty larceny.
This isn't petty larceny.
Ty—
This idea is potentially worth millions of dollars.
Millions?
Yes .
You might be letting your imaginations run away with you.
Sir, I honestly don't think you're in any position to make that call.
I was U.S. Treasury Secretary, I'm in some position to make—
Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told to do in your freshmen address.
Well I would suggest that you let your imaginations run away with you on a new project.
You would.
Yes. Everyone at Harvard is inventing something. Harvard undergraduates believe that inventing a job is better than finding a job so I'll suggest again that the two of you come up with a new new project.
I'm sorry, but that's not the point.
Please arrive at the point.
You don't have to be an intellectual property expert to understand the difference between right and wrong.
And you're saying that I don't?
Of course I'm not saying that.
I'm saying that.
Really.
Sir—
Anne, how did they get this appointment? ANNE Colleagues of their father.
Let me tell you something, Mr. Winklevoss and...Mr. Winklevoss. Since you're on the subject of right and wrong. This action, this meeting, the two of you being here, is wrong. It's not worthy of Harvard. It's not what Harvard saw in you. You don't get special treatment.
We've never—
Start another project? Like we're making a diorama for the science fair?
And if you have a problem with that, Mr. Winklevoss—
We've never asked for special treatment.
—the courts are always at your disposal. Is there anything else I can do for you?
Well you could take the Harvard Student Handbook and shoved it up—
Ty. Thank you very much for your time, sir.
I broke your 335 year old doorknob.
Eduardo, spring break, you and Mr. Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.
Yes.
What was the purpose of the trip?
Who paid for the trip?
It was paid for out of the thousand dollar account I'd set up a few months earlier.
At this point your thousand dollars was the only money that had been put into the company.
Yes.
How did you feel the meetings went?
They went terribly.
Why?
Mark was asleep.
I wasn't asleep.
Can I re-phrase my answer?
Sure.
I wish he'd been asleep.
...and we're at 29 schools now with over 75,000 members. People who go on theFacebook tend to stay on longer than almost any other site, now here's the most impressive statistic—91% of people who try it once will come back. Now if you'll allow me—
It wasn't a "tsk", it was uh...hmm...like a glottal stop. Almost a gag reflex.
There was one more meeting scheduled for the New York trip.
Yes. It was a dinner. It was set up through my girlfriend at the time.
Would you say that Mark was excited about this meeting?
Yes, very. 66 is a hip and trendy restaurant in Tribeca. The young crowd is drinking cocktails of all different colors and wearing
They're not gonna card us.
They might.
Look around.
It'll be embarrassing.
Tell him they're not gonna card us.
They're not gonna card us.
Mark—
Are you gonna talk about ads again?
Unless you're the Ballet Theatre of Hartford, the purpose of a business is to make a profit.
This isn't a business yet.
That's tough for me because my job is to— nevermind.
He's 25 minutes late.
He founded Napster when he was 19, he can be late.
He's not a god.
What is he?
25 minutes late.
I think Wardo's jealous.
I honestly wasn't jealous. I was nervous.
Why?
I didn't know him at all but I'd done a search and I'd asked around. He struck me as kind of a wild card.
Why?
He crashed out of two pretty big internet companies in spectacular fashion and he's had a reputation with drugs.
He also founded the companies.
We don't need him.
He's here.
And he does own a watch.
Take your time. And he does own a watch.
Stop it.
I'm Sean Parker.
How do you do.
You must be Eduardo. And Christy. And Mark, it's great to meet you.
Great to meet you.
You guys don't have anything in front of you. Tori.
We were waiting for—
Can you bring out some things. The lacquered pork with that ginger confit? Tuna tartar and a lobster claws, that'll get us started. Christy, what do you like to drink?
An appletini?
Great. Four of those.
From that point on it was the Sean-a- thon.
The question was "What did you talk about?"
He took us through his episode with Napster.
I didn't want to spend my 20's as a professional defendant. Who knew—the music industry doesn't have a sense of humor. We tried to sell the company to pay the 35 million they said we owed in royalties but I guess to them that was a little like selling a stolen car to pay for the stolen gas. So we said screw it and declared bankruptcy.
But you made a name for yourself.
And you are dry. Tori?
No, I'm good.
And then he went on to his second business venture, which was an online rolodex that he got thrown out of by Case Equity.
And I wanted to do it nice this time. I put on a tie and I shined my shoes but nobody wants to take orders from a kid so let me tell you what happens to a 20 year old at the top of a hot dot com:
I'm not a psychiatrist, but—
I'm glad we've got that on the record.
You're not a psychiatrist but what?
A psychiatrist would say he was paranoid.
They'll hire private detectives who'll follow you day and night. You're a target for high priced escorts. I can't prove it but I know they tapped my phones. Whatever it is that's gonna trip you up you've done already. Private behavior is a relic of a time gone by. And if somehow, someway, you've managed to live your life like the Dalai Lama then they'll make shit up. Because they don't want you, they want your idea and then they want you to say thank you while you— excuse me—wipe your chin and walk away.
That's what happened to you?
And delusional.
Yes. There'll be payback at Case. I brought down the record companies with Napster and Case's gonna suffer for their sins too.
You didn't bring down the record companies. They won.
In court.
Yes.
You want to buy a Tower Records, Eduardo?
And he told story after story about life in Silicon Valley, and parties at Stanford and down in LA, and friends who'd become millionaires, but mostly how Mark had to— had to come to California. And then he got around to theFacebook.
Tell me about your progress.
Well...we're in 29 schools now and we have over 75,000 members—
Okay. For instance, we wanted Baylor in Texas but Baylor already had a social network on campus so instead of going right after them, we made a list of every school within a hundred miles—
—and put theFacebook on those campuses first.
Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were seeing their friends on our site we were in.
That's called the Little Big Horn, that's smart, Mark.
Thank you, it was mine.
Easy.
Settle an argument for us, would you? I say it's time to start making money from theFacebook but Mark doesn't want advertising. Who's right?
Neither of you yet. TheFacebook is cool, that's what it's got going for it.
Yeah.
You don't want to ruin it with ads because ads aren't cool.
Exactly.
It's like you're throwing the greatest party on campus and someone's telling you it's gotta be over at 11:00.
That's exactly right.
You don't even know what the thing is yet.
I said exactly that.
How big it can get and how far it can go. This is no time to take your chips down. A million dollars isn't cool. You know what's cool?
You?
A billion dollars. And that shut everybody up.
And that's where you're headed. A billion dollar valuation. Unless you take bad advice in which case you may as well have come up with a chain of very successful yogurt shops. When you go fishing you can catch a lot of fish or you can catch a big fish. You ever walk into a guy's den and see a picture of him standing next to fourteen trout?
No, he's holding a 3000 pound marlin.
Yep.
That's a good analogy.
Okay, but we all know that marlins don't really weigh 3000 pounds, right?
Have you seen the big ones up close?
I haven't but I don't think the guy's holding a marlin the size of a Range Rover. That would be a really big fish and a very strong guy.
You think we might be getting away from the point?
I don't have a dog in this fight. I'm just a fan who came to say hi.
He owned Mark after that dinner.
He picked up the check, he told Mark they'd talk again soon and he was gone. But not before he made his biggest contribution to the company.
Drop the "the". Just Facebook. It's cleaner.
Shit.
That's gotta be some kind of land speed record for talking.
You want to end the party at eleven.
I'm trying to pay for the party.
There won't be a party unless it's cool, What'd you think?
Sure, let's drop the "the".
I meant catching the marlin instead of the 14 trout. Doesn't that sound good?
If you're a trout.
I'm going to enter this into the record. Incorporation papers for Facebook, an LLC registered in Florida— Why Florida?
That's where my family lives.
—and ask the respondent to stipulate that the articles of incorporation state the ownership as follows: 65 percent for Mark Zuckerberg, 30 percent for Eduardo Saverin and 5 percent for Dustin Moskovitz.
We stipulate.
And that was April 13th, 2004.
You can mark it.
Do you have anything here?
Yes, thank you. Mr. Saverin, have you ever done anything that might be considered legitimate grounds for termination?
No.
You never did anything to embarrass the company or even seriously jeopardize it?
No.
No?
No.
You were accused of animal cruelty.
Wait—
You weren't?
This isn't happening.
I have an article here from The Crimson —
Jesus Christ—
I can't have this, Wardo.
Oh come on, this is bullshit, this is another club playing a prank.
I'd gotten into the Phoenix. I'd been accepted and as part of my initiation I had to, for one week, carry with me at all times and take of, a chicken.
They identify you as one of the founders of Facebook. "Junior Eduardo Saverin"— I'm not the expert but being connected to torturing animals is probably bad for business.
I did not torture the chicken, I don't torture chickens, are you crazy?
No and settle down please. I have here an article from the Crimson —
This is scathing.
Nine-hundred and fifty-six.
I was having dinner in the Kirkland Dining Hall with Mark and I had the chicken with me because I had to have the chicken with me at all times. This was college.
Somebody's gonna have to answer for this.
Nine—hundred sixty-nine.
The dining hall was serving chicken for dinner and I had to feed my chicken so I just...I took little pieces of chicken and I gave it to the chicken. Someone must have seen me because the next thing I knew I was being accused of forced cannibalism.
I didn't know you can't do that. I dealt with the various animal rights groups, I dealt with the Associate Dean of the College, this was all resolved.
Nine-hundred and eighty-eight.
Someone from the Porc or the Fly must have reported it. For all I know it was the Winklevosses.
Alright, let's just forget about it.
This is absurd. I'm being accused of animal cruelty. It's better to be accused of necrophilia.
It is better to be accused of necro—
I'm going to have to explain this to my father, I'm going to have to explain this to everybody, I'm going to have to—what is happening on that ?
I have my final coming up for "Postwar and Contemporary Art" and I haven't been to class. I'm supposed to write about those four paintings.
That's a Facebook page.
Yeah, I opened it under an alias. I posted the paintings and asked people to comment. Every once in a while I hop on and stir the pot to get a good debate going.
Mr. Zuckerberg was cheating on his final exam?
I'd rather not answer that, Gretchen.
Why not?
Because I'm not suing him for cheating on his final exam that's not what friends do.
Well you just told us he was cheating.
Oops . You told your lawyers I was torturing animals?!
No, he didn't tell us about it at all. Our litigators are capable of finding a Crimson article. In fact when we raised the subject with him he defended you.
Oops.
Nine ninety-three, we are so close.
That reminds me, we're gonna need more money, Wardo.
Yeah, no, I agree. More servers, more help—
—I'm interviewing two interns to come to Palo Alto and we're gonna have to pay them something.
What?
I already found a house for rent on a street two blocks from the Stanford campus. It's perfect and it's got a pool.
When did you decide to go to California for the summer?
You mean when did I actually decide?
Somewhere in the middle of The Sean Parker Variety Hour?
He was right. California's the place we've gotta be.
You're Jed Clampett?
I didn't know you guys got The Beverly Hillbillies in Bra—
Yes, we got the show in Brazil, it was genius.
What's your problem with Sean?
He doesn't bring anything to the table. He doesn't have money, Dustin's a better programmer—
He's got connections to VCs.
We don't need VCs, we need advertisers and I've got connections to VCs.
The real players and—
Look—
—as someone who's just really embarrassed the company in a bad way I wouldn't—
It was the Winklevosses, Mark I
Hang on. Hit refresh.
150,004.
150,000 members, Wardo.
Congratulations, dude.
Congratulations.
You don't think it was strange that he was followed by private detectives?
Who came up with nothing.
Enough to get him out of the company. The drugs, the girls—
We don't know any of that's true.
You can read about it.
And I can read about you torturing birds. Since when does reading something—
Don't fish eat other fish?! The marlins and the trout?!
What's he talking about?
I'm interviewing interns at 10 tomorrow night in the CS lab. Get on board with this, man. You know, I don't know what else to say.
Eduardo!
Yo. Mark?
Yeah.
What's goin' on?
They have 10 minutes to get root access to a Python Webserver, expose its SSL encryption and then intercept all traffic over its secure port.
They're hacking.
Yes, all behind a Pix Firewall Emulator. But here's the beauty.
You know I didn't understand anything you just said, right?
I do know that.
What's the beauty?
Every 10th line of code written, they have to drink a shot. And hacking's supposed to be stealth, so anytime the server detects an intrusion, the candidate responsible has to drink a shot. I also have a program running that has a pop-up window appear simultaneously on all five computers—the last candidate to hit the window has to drink a shot. Plus every three minutes they all have to drink a shot.
Three minutes. All five candidates drain their shot glasses and slam them down where they get re-filled by the pretty Asian girl.
Can I ask—what part of the interns' jobs will they need to be able to do drunk?
You're right. A more relevant test might be seeing if they can keep a chicken alive for a week. That was mean.
Here.
What's this?
I opened a new account and put $18,000 in it. Will that get you through the summer?
Welcome to Facebook.
$18,000.
Yes .
In addition to the $1000 you'd already put up.
Yes.
A total of $19,000 now.
Yes.
Hang on.
I'm just checking your math on that. Yes, I got the same thing.
May I continue?
After expressing misgivings about Mr. Zuckerberg taking the company and moving it to California for the summer, why did you put $18,000 in an account for his use?
I figured we were partners and I wanted to be a team player. I figured Mark, Dustin and the new interns could work on the site while I was generating advertiser interest in New York. But mostly I figured...how much could go wrong in three months?
You sure? ERIC Yeah.
Yikes. And at that moment a stray brick drops from the roof and crashes through a glass patio table.
That's the doorbell.
I didn't know we had a doorbell.
Andrew! Get the door!
No, he's wired in.
Andrew.
Good boy.
Mark? Do
you live here? Yeah. Do
you?
We were right across the street, we saw the chimney come—
Yeah.
Is anybody hurt?
No. You live across the street?
This is my—Sharon. She lives across the street I was helping her move out when we saw the chimney—
Yeah, we had a zip line to the pool.
You came to California.
Yeah.
You made the right choice.
This house and this team are great. It's exactly what it should be.
I'm Sean Parker.
He's wired in.
That's what I'm talkin' about. Where's Eduardo?
He's got an internship in New York.
Eduardo didn't come out?
I was crashing there for a little bit while I'm taking care of some things. But she's done for the summer so she's back at her parents' place.
What's your plan for the summer?
Mark?
I'm sorry, I was looking at the architecture.
I asked what your plan—
A hundred schools by the end of the summer.
Okay.
Your date looks so familiar to me.
She looks familiar to a lot of people.
What do you mean?
He starts a catalogue, opens three more stores and after five years, he sells the company to Leslie Wexner and The Limited for four million dollars. Happy ending, right? Except two years later the company's worth 500 million dollars and Roy Raymond jumps off the Golden Gate Bridge. Poor guy just wanted to buy his wife a pair of thigh-highs, you know?
Was that a parable?
My date's a Victoria's Secret model, that's why she looks familiar to you.
God.
Don't be impressed by all this, I read your blog.
Oh, you know, that was—
You know why I started Napster? A girl I loved in high school was with the co¬ captain of the varsity lacrosse team and I wanted to take her from him so I decided to come up with the next big thing.
I didn't know th—
Napster wasn't a failure. I changed the music industry for better and for always. It may not have been good business but it pissed a lot of people off. And wasn't that what your Facemash was about? They're scared of me, pal, and they're gonna be scared of you. What the VC's want is to say, "Good idea, kid. The grown-ups'll take it from here." But not this time. This is our time. This time you're gonna hand 'em a business card that says "I'm CEO... bitch", that's what I want for you, so where the hell's Eduardo?
He's in New York.
Suckin' up to ad execs.
He's got an—
—an internship? The company's here. A billion dollar company is here. Do you live and breathe Facebook?
Yes.
Wardo wants to be a businessman and for all I know he's gonna be a good one but he shouldn't be in New York kissing Madison Avenue's ass. This is a once-in-a- generation-holy-shit idea and the water under the Golden Gate is freezing cold. Look at my face and tell me I don't know what I'm talking about.
Do you ever think about the girl?
What girl?
The one—the girl in high school who was— with the lacrosse thing.
No. The girls comes back—
A hundred schools by the end of the summer?
Yeah.
Tell you what, gesture of good faith. While you're getting into a hundred schools. I'll put you on two continents.
If you don't have a place to crash I think you should definitely come and live with us.
Let's line up some shots. Excuse me.
You can take this away and bring out the 1942.
Tyler. AIDE Tremendous race.
Thank you.
This is my brother, Cameron. AIDE Excellent. (to the blue-blazered man behind him) Sir. His Royal Highness, Prince Albert.
Ah. AIDE Your highness, this is Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.
Of course. Brilliant race. I've never seen a race that close.
Yes, sir.
My grandfather. Jack Kelly, was one of the premiere rowers of his day. I've been coming to Henley for 30 years and I've never seen a race that close. Have you seen a race that close?
No, Your Highness. Mile and a half races are more commonly won by a boat length or two.
Yes, that's absolutely right. Brutally close.
May I introduce my teammates? This is Dave, he's our— AIDE I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse us.
On to the Dutch!
I'm sorry you had to fly all the way over to see that.
I wouldn't have missed it, brother. How was the royalty?
I just wanted him to tell me a couple more times how close the race was a couple of more times. Brutal. It was brutally close. Excruciatingly brutal. Never seen a race so excruciatingly
Cam, the guy's the prince of a country the size of Nantucket, relax it's fine—
Dad.
Mr. Winklevoss.
I'm sorry, that you and mom flew all the—
Oh. Mr. Kenwright. Dad, this is Mr. Kenwright, the head of our host family this week.
Your daughter doesn't go to school in the States?
They have Facebook at Cambridge?
That's awesome.
I'm gonna watch the race film. If this online I wanna see it.
Stop it. Stop it, Cameron. Knock it off. I don't mind that we lost to the Dutch today by less than a second. That was a good race, that was a fair race and they'll see us again. What I mind —and what you should mind —is showing up on Monday for a race that was run on Sunday. We tried talking to him ourselves, we tried writing a letter, we tried the Ad Board, and we tried the president of the University. Now I'm asking you. For the last time! Let's take the considerable resources at our disposal and sue him in federal court!
Come on.
I need a real drink.
Screw it. Let's gut the freakin' nerd.
That's what I'm talking about. There's a thunderstorm going on outside and rain is beating
Check it out, I saw him today. Manningham, Mitchell Manningham, my Case Equity guy—hang on. Are you guys using spikes or ghost missiles? GIRL #1 We don't know, we're just shooting at each other.
Use sweet kamakazis. GIRL #1 Like we know what that is.
I saw him getting into his turbo Carerra and he saw me too, I know he did. Don't sweat it, I'm on a land line.
Does, anybody hear that banging?
You don't hear anything, you're writing code.
Dude, somebody's at the door.
It's not a dish best served cold. It's best served immediately and relentlessly.
I'm gonna call you back. What's up?
What's up? Mark was supposed to pick me up at the airport an hour ago, I've been calling his cell.
He was on a 36 hour coding tear so he took a nap for a couple of hours.
What happened here?
Not happened—happening. The next big thing.
Wardo!
Hey man.
Back to work. GIRL #2 The more bad I get at this, the more wasted I get. I meant the more—
We understand.
How old are they, Sean?
It's not polite to ask.
Sean, how old are they?
You think you know me. Right?
I've read enough.
You know how much I've read about you? Nothing.
Wardo.
I waited an hour for you at the airport.
What time is it?
It's midnight. Or 3AM in New York where I just came from.
You've gotta see some of the new stuff we've got. Dustin, show him the wall. I'm just calling it the wall.
Forget the wall, tell him about the meeting I've got set up. You know Peter Thiel?
No.
No reason you should. He just runs a two- billion dollar hedge fund called Clarium Capital.
Why's he setting up meetings?
Thiel may want to make an angel investment.
I don't care if he's an actual angel, why's he setting up business meetings?
You've had a long flight.
No, I've had a long wait on the tarmac at JFK, then a long wait at the passenger loading and unloading zone at SFO and in between there was a long flight. I'm the business end of this company and he's a house guest living here rent-free on a generous grant from the Eduardo Saverin Foundation.
I heard about your big ticket ad buys lined up.
Hey, man—
Gary's Tuxedos, the Harvard Bartending Course. You're just one small step away from bagging Snookies Cookies, I can feel it.
Want to talk to me alone for a minute? Sure.
You're not.
How's it going? How's the internship? How's Christy?
How's the internship?
Yeah.
Mark...Jesus, I quit the internship. We've talked about this on the phone, were you even—I quit on my first day.
I do remember you saying that. How's Christy?
Christy's crazy.
Is that fun?
No I mean she's actually psychotic. She' insanely jealous, she's irrational and I'm frightened of her.
Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.
I do not want that guy representing himself as part of this company.
You gotta move out here, Wardo, this is where it's all happening.
Did you hear what I just said?
The connections, the energy—
Mark—
I'm afraid if you don't come out here you're going to get left behind. I want— I want—I need you out here, please don't tell him I said that.
What did you just say?
It's moving faster than any of us ever even imagined and—
What do you mean get left behind?
It's moving fast and Sean even thinks that—
Sean is not part of the company.
We have over 300,000 members, Wardo, we're in 160 schools including—
I'm aware of that.
—five in Europe.
We need more servers than I ever imagined we'd need. We need more programmers. And we need more money. And he set up the Thiel meeting. He's set up meetings all around town.
He's set up other meetings?
Yes.
Without me knowing anything about it?!
You're in New York!
I'm in New York riding subways 14 hours a day trying to find advertisers!
And how's it going so far?!!
What did you mean get left behind?
I'd like to freeze this bank account and cancel all existing checks and lines of credit.
Yeah, sure. 80 stories of polished granite.
No problem. You know this is where they filmed Towering Inferno.
That's comforting.
Oh yeah, we're cool.
Hi.
Jesus Christ.
When did you get back?
You scared me. I need you to knock.
When did you get back?
I got back this afternoon.
And when were you going to call me?
Chris, it was kind of a rough trip and I was tired and—
Or answer one of my 47 texts? Did you know I sent 47 texts?
I did, and I thought that was incredibly normal behavior.
Are you mocking me?
I brought you a present.
Why does your status say "single" on your Facebook page?
What?
Why does your relationship status say "single" on your Facebook page?
I was single when I set up the page.
And you just never bothered to change it?
I —
What?!
I don't know how.
Do I look stupid to you?
No. Calm down.
It's a little embarrassing so you should take it as a sign of trust that I would tell you that.
Go to hell.
Take it easy.
No, you didn't change it so you could screw Silicon Valley sluts every time you go out to see Mark.
That is not even remotely true and I can promise you that the Silicon Valley sluts don't care what anyone's relationship status is on Facebook. Please, open your present.
Oh, your phone does work.
It's Mark.
Okay, this is gonna be tricky. Here, open your present. It's a silk scarf.
Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?
This'll be your first.
Yeah.
You froze our account? In the background there's a small celebration going on with
I did.
You froze the account.
I had to get your attention, Mark.
Do you realize that you jeopardized the entire company? Do you realize that your actions could have permanently destroyed everything I've been working on?
We ' ve been working on.
Without money, the site can't function. Let me tell you the difference between Facebook and everybody else: WE DON'T
If the servers are down for even a day, our entire reputation is irreversibly destroyed. Users are fickle. Friendster has proven that fact.
Look—
Even a few people leaving would reverberate through the entire user base. The users are interconnected, that's the whole point! College kids are online because their friends are online and if one domino goes, all the dominos go! Do you get that?! I'm not going back to Caribbean Night at A-E-Pi!
Holy shit! What is wrong with you?
Did you like being nobody?! Did you like being a joke?! Do you wanna go back to that?!
Hang on, hang on.
That was the act of a child, not a businessman.
And it certainly wasn't the act of a friend. You know how embarrassed I was for me to try and cash a check today? I'm not going back to that life. Maybe you were frustrated.
Yeah!
Maybe you were angry.
I was !
But I'm willing to let bygones be bygones because, Wardo, I've got some good news.
I'm sorry. I was angry and maybe it was childish. But I had to get your attention.
Wardo, I said I've got some good news.
What is it?
Peter Thiel's just made an angel investment of a half a million dollars.
What?
A half a million dollars and he's setting us up in an office. They want to re¬ incorporate the company, they want to meet you they need your signature on some documents so get your ass on the next flight back to San Francisco. I need my CFO.
I'm on my way.
Wardo.
Yeah.
We did it.
Wardo?
Aaggh!
You going back there already?
Yes. Also I'm breaking up with you. A glass conference room in the corner of a glass bullpen on a high floor of a high rise. Cartons are being unpacked, computers are everywhere along with bags of potato chips and boxes of cereal.
How many shares of stock will I own?
Jesus Christ.
Because you may need to dilute it to award shares to new investors.
Economics.
Mark doesn't care about money and he needs to be protected.
I can live with that.
Eduardo?
Could you please repeat the question?
No. It was an outrageously leading question the first time around and now you want us to hear it again?
Yes, would you read it back, please.
Well, go ahead.
No. It was insanely stupid of me not to have my own lawyers look over all the...the, uh...in all honesty I thought they were my lawyers. I was your only friend. You had one friend. My father won't even look at me.
Okay. Eduardo? Did Mr. Zuckerberg say anything to you after you signed the papers?
There was a lot of handshaking and a lot of congratulations. He'd already told me that he wouldn't be coming back to school for at least a semester so we were saying goodbye for a while. And then before I left, he said—
But you gotta come back. Somewhere around the end of November/early December. Peter wants to throw us an amazing party when we hit a million members, it's gonna be out of control. You've gotta come back for it.
A million members.
Yeah.
Remember the algorithm on the window at Kirkland?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be here. A brand new black Escalade pulls up in front of a gleaming
You sure about this?
You're 20 minutes late. You're going to walk in there and say you overslept and you didn't have time to get dressed. They're gonna pitch you. Case Equity is gonna pitch you. They're gonna beg you to take their money. You're gonna nod, you're gonna nod, you're gonna nod and then you're gonna say, "Which one of you is Roth—" No, not Roth, Manningham. "Which one of you is Mitchell Manningham?". And he'll say, "I am". And you say, "Sean Parker says 'Fuck you' and on walk out.
Okay.
In late November I got the e-mail from Mark telling me to come out for the millionth member party.
What else did the e-mail say?
It said that we had to have a business meeting. That Mark and Sean had played some kind of revenge stunt on Case Equity and that Manningham was so impressed that he was making an investment offer that was hard to turn down.
I went out to California and I went straight to the new offices. And it's clear that we're in the offices of a new, high-tech, very successful internet company. The Facebook logo in blue metallic letters on the wall, the maple desks, new computer monitors, carpeting, a wall covered in graffiti by an artist commissioned for the job and tons of young employees.
I didn't know whether to dress for the party or for the business meeting so I kind of dressed for both. We see that most of the employees, especially the women, are dressed to go to an after-work, late-night party.
But it didn't matter.
Why not?
Because I wasn't called out there for either one.
What were you called out there for?
An ambush.
At first I thought he was joking, giving me more contracts to sign. But then I started reading.
Wait, what is this?
What is this?
Mark?
Mark.
He's wired in.
I'm sorry?
He's wired in.
Is he?
Yes.
How 'bout now, are you still wired in?
leaning against) Call security. Everyone in the office is frozen, silent and watching.
You issued over 24-million new shares of stock.
You were told that if new investors came along—
How much were your shares diluted? How much were his?!
What was Mr. Zuckerberg's ownership share diluted down to?
It wasn't.
What was Mr. Moskovitz's ownership share diluted down to?
It wasn't.
What was Sean Parker's ownership share diluted down to?
It wasn't.
What was Peter Thiel's ownership share diluted down to?
It wasn't.
What was your ownership share diluted down to?
Point-zero-three percent.
You signed the papers.
You set me up.
You're gonna blame me because you were the business head of the company and you made a bad business deal with your own company?!
It's gonna be like I'm not part of Facebook.
It's won't be like you're not part of Facebook, you're not part of Facebook.
My name's on the masthead.
You might wanna check again.
This is because I froze the account?
You think we were gonna let you parade around in your ridiculous suits pretending you were running this company?
Sorry, my Prada's at the cleaners along with my hoodie and my fuck-you flip-flops you pretentious douchebag.
Security's here. You'll be leaving now.
I'm not signing those papers.
We'll get the signature.
Tell me this isn't about me getting into the Phoenix!
You did it. I always knew you did it. You planted the story about the chicken.
What is he talking about?
You had me accused—
Seriously, what the hell's the chicken?
And I'll bet what you hated the most is that they identified me as a co-founder of Facebook —which I am! You better lawyer- up, asshole, 'cause I'm not cornin' back for my 30 percent, I'm cornin' back for everything !
Get him outa here.
I'm going.
Hang on.
I almost forgot, there's your $19,000. I wouldn't cash it, though, I drew it on the account you froze.
I like standing next to you, Sean. It makes me look so tough.
That's it, that's our show for tonight, people. So I want to see everybody here geared up for a party. We're gonna walk down to the club like it's the Macy's Parade. Mackey, put it up on the big screen, we've gotta be almost there. A young employee hits a remote and a few keys on his computer and a huge flat-screen displays a Facebook page with a read¬ out of the number of members. 999,942 There's scattered applause and excitement as everyone watches.
You alright?
Yeah. You were kinda rough on him.
You know you didn't have to be that rough on him.
Listen, I'm putting together a party—
Sean? You didn't have to be that rough on him.
He almost killed it. I'll send flowers. Speaking of flowers, I'm putting together a party after the party at Kappa Eta Sigma. Ashleigh's a sister.
Uh...Ashleigh?
The intern.
No, yeah, I know who she is. Are you guys—
Ashleigh? Me? No. A little bit. Oh no, do you like her? Dude—
No. No. I was just, no.
We were just talkin' about you.
Just that you're doing a really good job.
Put them on my desk.
What's the package?
Nothing.
Mackey!
Refresh!
The next transformative development? A picture sharing application. A place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life. It is...the true digitalization of real life. You don't just go to a party anymore, you go to a party with your digital camera and your friends relive the party on Facebook. And tagging. The idea—
I've spent hours watching what people do when they log on.
How they check their friends' status updates, checked to see which of their friends had changed their profiles, changed their photos and mostly...
We lived on farms and then we lived in cities and now we're gonna live on the internet.

Was the music too loud? We have a celebration going.
I can have them turn the music down.

No sir, no.
I don't.
It's an Epipen.
That's my inhaler.
Hello?
Listen, something's happened.
Shit.
It's alright, it's gonna be alright. I've posted bond and I wasn't doing anything. I mean, I've got allergies so I can't—
Interns?
It was just a party.
This is gonna be news, Sean, it's gonna be online any second.
I know.
You know with an intern and—
It's cool, I've got it under control.
I'll get it under control. I'll call someone and see what the next move is. But this is gonna be news now.
You don't think Eduardo was involved do you? Do you think—
No.
Or Manningham. One of them. Somebody. Somebody sent that coke in their 'cause it got in there. You believe me. This is gonna be fine, right?
Go home, Sean.
Mark?
Mark?
We're done for the day.
Yeah. Yeah. I was just sitting here.
What happened to Sean?
He still owns 7% of the company. All you had all day was that salad. You want to get something to eat?
I can't.
I'm not a bad guy.
I know that. When's there's emotional testimony I assume 85% of it is exaggeration.
And the other 15%?
Perjury. Creation myths need a devil.
What happens now?
Sy and the others are having a steak on University Ave. Then they'll come back up to the office and start working on a settlement agreement to present to you.
They're gonna settle?
Oh yeah. And you're gonna have to pay a little extra.
Why?
So that these guys sign a non-disclosure agreement. They say one unflattering word about you in public and you own their wife and kids.
I invented Facebook.
I'm talking about a jury. I specialize in voir dire—jury selection. And what the jury sees when they look at the defendant. Clothes, hair, speaking style, likability—
Likability?
I've been licensed to practice law for all of 20 months and I could get a jury to believe you planted the story about Eduardo and the chicken. Watch what else. Why weren't you at Sean's sorority party that night?
You think I'm the one who called the police?
Doesn't matter. I asked the question and now everybody's thinking about it. You've lost your jury in the first 10 minutes.
Farm animals?
Yeah.
I was drunk and angry and stupid.
And blogging.
And blogging.
Pay them. In the scheme of things it's a speeding ticket. That's what Sy will tell you tomorrow.
Do you think anybody would mind if I stayed and used the computer for a minute?
I can't imagine it would be a problem.
Thanks. I appreciate your help today.
You're not an asshole, Mark. You're just trying so hard to be.
