a quiz where you can test your knowledge of dialogue from The Social Network (2010)

## Why
The social network is one of my favorite movies of all time, and when I first watched I'm pretty sure I looped the thing 17 times. I've had a lot of the dialogue memorized, especially since I have the screenplay downloaded on my phone and read it when I don't have internet on planes and car rides, but I wanted to properly test my knowledge and wrote a quick script to isolate the dialogue from the screenplay (.txt file found on [internet archive](https://archive.org/stream/thesocialnetwork_screenplay/thesocialnetwork_screenplay_djvu.txt)) and a crappy javascript website where you can play the game. This took embarrassingly long.          
<br>
At some point, this stopped being all that interesting (I played enough of the game in the terminal before I got an actual website up) and became more of a petty feud I had with myself. I had to get this done just because I started it, not because it was technically challenging, cool, or in any way compelling to other people. I'm pretty sure this is a common problem.

## Methodology
You may be going through my .java files going "Meghana, why did you make both isolateDialogue and editRawScript and also 4 different .txt files and "wow it looks like you've never made a website before" and "did it really take eleven hours to do this". And to that I say          
1) I wanted each rehaul of changing the script to be different for debugging and also I'm lazy.           
2) This is the first time I'm making a website that uses both java as backend and js and frontend. Usually all my websites are just pure html static stuff.       
3) I've made some mistakes.        

## Notes
The biggest time-suck was isolating all the dialogue. I needed to get all the lines after an all-caps character name (ex. MARK) and needed to stop collecting lines after there was stage direction or a CUT TO:, and man was that tough to get around. Even though this project's pretty inane, it was fun to figure out that puzzle, and it was kinda like being back in APCSA again. Shout out to Mr. Young.

## Exigence
I thought of this while sitting on the toilet.
